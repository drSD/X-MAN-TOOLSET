It supports the W process which captures both component and system life cycles. The extension FX-MAN provides the capability of modelling variability in order to support constructing product families.

X-MAN II toolset is developed using Eclipse model-driven engineering. Essentially, it is EMF framework instantiated with meta-models of X-MAN component model and its extensions.
